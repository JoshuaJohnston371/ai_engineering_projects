PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY
Data Analyst with 7 years’ experience across product analytics, experimentation, machine-learning insights, and automated data engineering. I specialise in turning messy data into clear answers, building fast and reliable SQL pipelines, and creating dashboards that help remote product and ML teams make better decisions.

My career started in programmatic advertising, where I built strong foundations in data analysis, automation, and experimentation. Over the last two years at Luxury Escapes, I’ve focused heavily on ML-powered product analytics, experiment measurement, API-driven automation, and customer-behaviour insights — including earning the company’s “Star Award” for high-impact analytical work.

Strong in SQL, Python, BigQuery, Looker/Tableau, experiment design, ML diagnostics, and building end-to-end automated reporting systems. I thrive in remote teams, love building tools that remove grunt work, and enjoy working across data, engineering, and product.

CORE SKILLS
Languages & Tools: SQL (advanced), Python (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn), BigQuery, DBT, Git
Analytics: A/B testing, metric design, statistical analysis, ML model evaluation
Dashboards & BI: Looker, Tableau, Looker Studio
Automation: Python ETL, GCP APIs (Slides, Drive), custom automation modules, workflow orchestration

Other: PySpark, AWS, Databricks, HTML scraping, Flask web apps

PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE

Machine Learning / Product Data Analyst
Luxury Escapes | Sydney (Hybrid/Remote) | Jan 2024 – Nov 2025

- Built ML-experiment dashboards that accurately measured test vs control performance for promotional-email timing models — enabling precise validation and helping drive a 23% uplift in conversions.
- Created a full end-to-end customer-call transcript analytics pipeline:
  - Pulled raw call data from BigQuery
  - Used Python + OpenAI API to classify sentiment, category, issue themes, summaries, and offer types
  - Pushed structured tables back into BigQuery
  - Visualised with Looker for CX teams
  → Enabled managers to quickly identify customer pain points, property issues, & recurring operational problems.
- Developed a custom Google Presentation Python module to automate weekly business reviews. Generated analytics tables + built slide decks end-to-end via API, saving ~6 hours per week across teams and standardising business reporting.
- Delivered ~$50K incremental margin uplift by matching previously unverified hotel rooms between suppliers using regex, similarity scoring, and string-normalisation — enabling better pricing decisions and reducing mismatches.
- Automated HTML → BigQuery fee extraction, converting inconsistent scraped surcharges into clean, reliable structured datasets.
- Built and maintained dashboards across Hotels, Flights, Experiences, CRM, and Search teams (Looker, Tableau).
- Became a go-to SQL resource for C-suite, PMs, and ML engineers — debugging complex SQL fast and improving analytical reliability.
- Conducted deep-dive analyses on customer behaviour (email clicks, product views, cart abandonment patterns) to help identify high-intent cohorts and guide promotional strategies.
- Collaborated daily with remote ML engineers (Israel) across time zones to troubleshoot models, validate experiments, and refine feature behaviour.

Senior Media Trader / Analyst
MiQ | Sydney | Nov 2018 – Sept 2023

- Managed large-scale programmatic advertising campaigns using The Trade Desk, Google AdX, and proprietary systems.
- Built optimisation models and automated analysis workflows using Python, PySpark, SQL, Databricks, AWS.
- Reduced campaign optimisation time by 50% through automated feature-importance modelling and algorithmic recommendations.
- Analysed impression-level performance data (clicks, conversions, spend distribution) to improve CTR, CVR, and CPA.
- Communicated insights directly to clients, strengthening data storytelling and stakeholder alignment.
- Developed dashboards for spend tracking, attribution insights, and contract-performance compliance.
- Sparked interest in ML/AI and began a Masters in Data Science during this period.
